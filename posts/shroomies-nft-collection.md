I created a collection of 500 unique mushrooms titled Shroomies (MUSH). This collection was made as a proof-of-concept for the various methods involved in the process. There is absolutely no utility and they have no value; theyâ€™re just for fun ðŸ™‚

**-Art generator:** using weighted attribute frequencies, all 500 images were randomly generated (along with their metadata) by a JS project

**-IPFS storage:** all images and metadata were uploaded to IPFS.

**-Smart contract deployment:** A solidity contract was created and compiled in Remix, using IPFS locations are parameters. This contract can be found on polygonscan here [0xc49e6cde4a903391824b99fd20a0094ccff7ab13](https://polygonscan.com/token/0xc49e6cde4a903391824b99fd20a0094ccff7ab13)

**-Opensea listing:** The collection is listed on Opensea. The remaining tokens will become visible as they are minted. See the collection at [Shroomies](https://opensea.io/collection/shroomies-v2)

**-Minting app:** An app that allows anyone to mint their very own Shroomie. This includes integration with MetaMask and other browser wallets. [Check it out](https://shroomies.redvelvetwiki.com/)

See my [GitHub](https://github.com/redvelvetzip) for more info on the programs used to create this collection. Big shoutout to HashLips!
