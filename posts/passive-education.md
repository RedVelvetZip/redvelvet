Learning about personal finance can be difficult if you try to dive in head first; it’s too vast of a subject to binge. You may find a ‘relaxed approach’ to learning to be more successful. I personally enjoy having informational content mixed into my social media feeds, so I can gently learn in small bits and pieces – retaining the information over time. It doesn’t feel like work because I’m mostly relaxing, but I do retain information when I’m receiving it on frequent small intervals, such as reading a twitter thread/reddit post here and there.

Here’s a collection of communities that I follow now, or have followed in the past to get my passive educational content from. They’re color coded to find relevant communities at a glance
