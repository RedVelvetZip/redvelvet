There are a **TON** of cryptocurrencies and blockchains out there. Bitcoin is the one everyone knows because it started it all, but not every altcoin aims to be like BTC. There are many use cases for blockchain technology, resulting in numerous projects. Some cryptos referenced in this article are so different in function that they can hardly be compared. I’ll be breaking down different types of cryptocurrencies and giving examples of each here.

## First, a few important points:

---

- this list is not comprehensive

- many cryptos belong to more than one group

- some classifications may be up for debate

## Store Of Value

---

**Bitcoin, Bitcoin forks (BSV), Litecoin, Terra**

I’m sure you’ve heard someone refer to Bitcoin as ‘digital gold’ before. Bitcoin is the first ever scarce digital object, and it was born from the 2008 financial crisis. Fiat currencies such as the US dollar lose some value to inflation every single year. Store of value cryptos strive to be a solution to that problem. BTC has a maximum supply, unlike fiat; this make it scarce. Scarcity limits supply, so as adoption and usage increase the demand, the price can only go in one direction. This is one of the most subjective categories, as really any crypto should act as a store of value.

## Smart Contract Layer 1

---

**Ethereum, Solana, Cardano, Avalanche**

Smart contract cryptocurrencies are an entire ecosystem. A smart contract is simply a protocol set to execute some predetermined action when requirements are met; this can mean sending a token to a wallet when a specific amount of ETH is received from that wallet. It acts as the intermediary, escrow, or authority between two parties; this allows decentralized ecosystems to exist, where you don’t need to trust the other party OR some central authority that wants to take a cut as the middle man – you only have to trust a computer protocol that is ideally open-source and audited. In short, a smart contract is a digital vending machine.

Ethereum is the first of its kind and the largest, and while many others in this category are direct copies, some are innovators of their own. Smart contract cryptos act as networks for these protocols to operate on.

## Smart Contract Layer 2

---

**Polygon Matic, Loopring**

Layer 2s are extensions of a Layer 1. For example, Loopring is a Layer 2 for Ethereum and only Ethereum; Layer 2s are built on top of a specific Layer 1 and work exclusively with it. Layer 2s exist to improve upon speed, efficiency, accessibility, or some other feature of its underlying Layer 1. If they can improve all these features, why not just create your own network as a competitor? Well Layer 2s can still utilize all the advantages of their network such as security, existing user-base, and established connections. Layer 2s take many forms and don’t all aim to improve networks in the same way. I won’t get into the technologies that Layer 2s use here, but it mostly consists of running a parallel blockchain that periodically sends ‘compressed’ blocks to the main chain for validation.

## Privacy

---

**Monero, Zcash, Mina**

Blockchains are public ledgers. Everyone can see everything that’s happening. Anyone can go check the activity of a specific wallet address, or how much crypto it holds. This is not ideal in every situation, so some projects set out to preserve your privacy and keep this vital information from the blockchain. Privacy coins use various technologies to maintain a secure, decentralized blockchain of transactions without exposing sender addresses, recipient addresses, or even the amount of transactions. See my Monero article for more details on some of the technologies used – truly cool stuff.

## Payment

---

**Bitcoin Cash, Nano, Stellar Lumen, Dash**

This was one of the first use-cases of cryptos in general. Sure any coin can be used to pay someone, but some are simply not practical. To improve on established payment methods, these coins allow for instant transfers (no more 3-5 business day waits to get your money), low or no fees (Western Union’s business model is currency exchange fees for people sending money to other countries), and permission-less actions (no more needing to be approved by an institution to bank with them – be your own bank instead).

## Oracle

---

**Chainlink, Band**

Oracle cryptos act as just that, an oracle! They make real world information available to smart contracts (the date, the price of something, the outcome of an NBA game). This is different from an API because the data feeds are decentralized.

## Meme

---

**Doge, Shiba Inu, Banano**

Hype, pump & dumps, and scams. With the rare project that may survive. Please please please look at the market cap of these, not the coin price, when you’re looking at these. These coins are mostly made for fun (and without utility) if not to scam you, but hey they often have fun, tight-knit communities.
