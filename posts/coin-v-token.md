Coin and token are often used interchangeably when talking about cryptocurrencies. The truth is, they’re different and distinct things.

Every crypto exists on a network. Bitcoin runs on the Bitcoin blockchain, and Ethereum runs on the Ethereum blockchain. Some cryptos don’t run on their own blockchain; they use an existing blockchain to provide their infrastructure. A coin is an asset native to its blockchain, while a token is created on an existing blockchain.

Examples of coins include Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Monero

Examples of tokens include Shiba Inu, USDC, and Loopring

All of those token examples are ERC-20 tokens, even though they have very different use-cases. This means they run on Ethereum’s blockchain. Other chains that host tokens include Binance Smart Chain, Avalanche, and Solana.
