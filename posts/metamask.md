#MetaMask - Your Go-To Browser Wallet

##What is MetaMask?
MetaMask is a browser plugin that serves as an Ethereum wallet. In addition to Ethereum, you can manually add other networks such as Binance Smart Chain or Avalanche Network. MetaMask is compatible with most web browsers, as well as mobile. MetaMask can allow you to interact with decentralized apps, since you can’t connect your Coinbase or other exchange wallet directly to these dapps.

 
##How To Get Started:

Looking to use a DEX, buy an NFT, or just get your crypto off of an exchange? Then you’ll want to set up a MetaMask account. I’ll walk you through the steps here

1. Download MetaMask from https://metamask.io/

2. Open the plugin, select ‘Get Started’, and create a new wallet

3. Create a password. You’ll have to sign in to use your wallet as a layer of security, so it isn’t accessible if your device is left open.

4. Write down your seed phrase. It is extremely important that you store this phrase offline. Don’t take a screenshot, and don’t save it on your computer. This string of words is your only lifeline to recover your account if you damage your device or get locked out. Without this phrase, you can potentially lose your crypto in the account. It is equally important that you never share this phrase with anyone else. Scammers will ask you for it, pretending to be support or just a friendly person helping. Fraudulent websites may ask for this phrase, but you should never give it out and also be sure you’re on the proper URL.

5. Confirm your seed phrase

6. You’re up and running! Transfer some ETH or another token to the public address listed on your account and you can start to interact with dapps
Hardware Wallets for Added Security:

So you’re looking for added security? Not a bad move. Hardware wallets are objectively more secure than using MetaMask alone. If you own a Ledger or Trezor hardware wallet, you can create a new MetaMask account from your hardware wallet. Now the keys for this MetaMask account are stored on your Ledger/Trezor, and transactions from MM must be signed by your physical device before sending out. Ledger and Trezor have documentation for this process on their websites.

##Common Questions:

Q: I sent a new token to my wallet. Why can’t I see it?

A: You’ll sometimes need to manually add less popular tokens to your wallet. Don’t worry, the crypto is there, you just need to add it in settings before you can see it. Use Etherscan or your network’s equivalent service for this. Always check the URL to make sure you’re not on a mirrored fraudelent site. Scammers may create a mirrored site and promote it to the top of search results.

Q: I want to send a token that isn’t on the Ethereum network, can I do this on MetaMask?

A: Yes, you can do this once you manually add the network. Chainlist .org will provide the necessary information. Just as before, make sure you’re using reliable sources.
